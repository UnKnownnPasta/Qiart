## Qiart
Just a project for a program I'm in

## Files
All files in `assets` are kept there for the sake of neatness as they have no real use in viewing the code
Hence, while trying to run this the assets must be in the same directory as the `.html` and `.css` files

# How it works
Alright so, you scroll down and type in some project title or vague idea in the text box, fill in some param (currently working on making them useful ðŸ’€) and click create. This will load a canvas, and after a bit loads a sample text on the canvas based on your input. Currently all you can do is move the canvas borders around.
