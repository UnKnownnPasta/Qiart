## Qiart
Just a project for a program I'm in

## Files
'assets' contains some images for the website to use.

# How it works
Alright so, you scroll down and type in some project title or vague idea in the text box, fill in some param (currently working on making them useful ðŸ’€) and click create. This will load a canvas, and after a bit loads a sample text on the canvas based on your input. Currently all you can do is move the canvas borders around.
